# Twitter Sentiment Analysis üê¶

This project involves building a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as positive or negative. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and machine learning algorithms to achieve **76% accuracy** in sentiment classification.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of **9,873 tweets**, including text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Built and trained the sentiment analysis model, achieving an accuracy of **76%** with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- **Insights Delivered:** The model effectively identifies and categorizes user sentiments, enabling businesses to gain actionable insights from tweet data.
